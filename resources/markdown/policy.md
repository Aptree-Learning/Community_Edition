Other Important Privacy Information Notice to End-Users
Our Services are intended for use by enterprises. Our Services are made available to you through a Subscriber of ours; that enterprise is the data controller. Your data privacy questions and requests should initially be submitted to the Aptree LMS Subscriber as your data controller.

Aptree LMS's Subscribers can:
Restrict, suspend or terminate your access to the Services; access and describe the data you provided to them; access and export your data processed by them; and amend your data, including your end-user profile.
Data retention
Where Aptree LMS is the data controller of personal data (for example, personal data relating to Website Visitors, Attendees, and individuals who register to use our Services), then we retain the personal data we collect where we have an ongoing legitimate business need to do so (for example, to provide you with our Services, to enable your participation in an event, and to comply with applicable legal, tax or accounting requirements).
When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your data, we will either delete or aggregate it or, if this is not possible (for example, because your data has been stored in backup archives). We will securely store your data and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
Suppose your data is processed within a Subscriber's Service Data. In that case, we will process the personal data for as long as the relevant Subscriber instructs us, that is, the data controller of the Subscriber Service Data.
How to Exercise Your Data Protection Rights 
You have choices regarding your data. Below is a summary of those choices, exercise them, and any limitations.
Correcting, updating, and removing your information:
An individual who seeks to exercise their data protection rights in respect of personal data stored or processed by us on behalf of a Subscriber of ours within the Subscriber's Service Data (including to seek access to, or to correct, amend, delete, port or restrict processing of such personal data) should direct their query to our Subscriber (the data controller). Upon receiving a request from one of our Subscribers for us to remove the personal data, we will respond to their request within thirty (30) days. We will retain personal data that we process and store on behalf of our Subscribers for as long as needed to provide the Services to our Subscribers.

Our Services and related documentation on our Privacy and Data Protection site give Agents and End-Users the ability to access, update and delete specific personal data from within the Service. For example, you can access your Agent or End-User profile and update your data. In cases where we act as the data controller, we will provide you with whether we hold any of your data upon request. We will respond to such requests within a reasonable timeframe. Please note, however, that we may need to retain certain information for record-keeping purposes, to complete transactions, or to comply with our legal obligations.
Deactivating your user profile:
If you no longer wish to use our Services, Aptree LMS's Subscriber may deactivate your End-User account. First, please contact Aptree LMS's Subscriber with your request.

For more information on deleting your information, visit our Privacy and Data Protection site.
Request that we stop using your information:
You may request that your data no longer be accessed, stored, used, and otherwise processed where you believe that an Aptree LMS Subscriber or Aptree LMS does not have the appropriate rights.

You gave us consent to use your data for a limited purpose; you can withdraw that consent. You can also opt out of our data for marketing purposes by contacting us, as provided below. We may need time to investigate and facilitate your request when you make such requests. Please note that an Aptree LMS Subscriber should first contact Aptree LMS's Subscriber to stop access, storage, and use of personal data.
